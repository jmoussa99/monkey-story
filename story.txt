Marwan's brother, Karim decided to join Marwan and started eating fruit of his own.
Marwan got angry because he really likes fruits and doesn't want to share.
Karim then convinces Marwan that its better to share because it ensures their survival.
Suddenly a wild cheetah decides to attack the spidermonkey brothers...

The cheetah tried attacking Marwan but his brother distracted the wild animal.
While the cheetah was chasing down Karim, Marwan had time to hide in the 
bushes. He was scared and was not sure if he should help his brother.
